# DCR Hands on Lab for TKO


## Overview

**Summary:**  
Snowflake Data Clean Rooms enable multiple parties to answer questions about data while preventing drill down to PII, to overlap and join data without copying, moving or sharing the underlying data,  and to perform these analyses on large amounts of data with high performance and scalability.

This lab will demonstrate how two parties can run analyses across Snowflake accounts, securely  joining data on PII fields without revealing that PII to each other.

**Lab Prerequisites:**
* two Snowflake accounts (existing or newly created by you)
* minimum version Enterprise
* in the same Cloud/Region
* with ACCOUNTADMIN privileges
